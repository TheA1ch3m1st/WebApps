# Vegan Store Template

This is a usable template made for the EdYoda CSS3 Basics to Advanced course.

## Installation and Usage
This project only uses regular HTML5 and CSS3. Any browser should be able to render it correctly.

## How does it work?
This template was made for the course, but after making it, I realized that it could very well be used as an actual website for a project. It does NOT have a backend and is only made up of the frontend web-design aspects (HTML and CSS). It does include incomplete forms and several other functional aspects (like dropdowns).
